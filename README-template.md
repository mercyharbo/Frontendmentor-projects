## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS/SCSS

### What I learned

This is was an amazing small project I pick just to refresh myself after writing and learning React js for almost 2 weeks now. I decide to pick this up after completing my portfolio website which is rebuilt with React, you can see it here [ Code With Mercy ](https://codewithmercy/netlify.app)... The most tricky part of this project is adding the hover colour and icon but I got it done either way and it was amazing because I was able to learn more on how to design stuff like this, and also I make use of CSS Flexbox for the most part of this project because it's the only way I know that can give a very accurate result and make everything align as needed. 

I learn about SASS/SCSS a few months ago and since then all my project has been built using this because it makes my code clean and easy to edit anytime I want to change something now or in the future. Using it to build this project make my work faster and easy especially when I was trying to implement the hover on the NFT Image.  

Learning Git few months has made my life easier and better because I have been able to commit code changes anytime without opening GitHub, it also makes my projects easy because I was able to put them all together in a folder instead of having it in one repository per projects.
